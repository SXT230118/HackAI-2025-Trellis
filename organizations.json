Everyone tends to have a wide array of tastes, yet we all come together to enjoy the same shows. Aside from shows, our other activities include Kahoot trivia nights, Iron Cosplay, local events, anime merch swap/trade meets, potlucks, etc. We’re always open to new ideas for meetings as well so feel free to participate in the discussion.\nNow you may be wondering, why A3? The 3 stands for our three tenets: culture, social, and education. We seek to do what other anime clubs don't. We explore the culture in anime and integrate it into meetings and host grounds for making friends and establishing bonds. Not only can we take the time to appreciate anime and manga for what it is, but we can also take the time to dissect them and see how to better the lives of others as well.",

Bullet journaling encourages the idea of \"spreads\", which is a creative layout of everything planned for a certain time period. For example, creating a monthly spread would be decorating a cover page dedicated to the month's themes, and then creating a calendar and filling in important dates and deadlines within it. A weekly spread would be taking one week from the monthly calendar and focusing in on it more to highlight details on what is important for that given week. Bullet journaling appeals to those who are artistic and want to express themselves through beautiful calligraphy and stationery like stickers, cutouts, washi tape, colored pens, and more, but it also appeals to those who want a more organizational and functional form of planning. Outside of bullet journaling, our organization will also plan activities related to bullet journaling in some form such as calligraphy workshops, pen palling events, stationery swaps, and more. Most importantly, Bujo Buddies UTD emphasizes inclusion and friendship. We want everyone in our organization to feel comfortable and included as our members, and we want everyone to have their voices heard in terms of what type of events they would like to see. Whether one has been bullet journaling for years or is interested in getting started, Bujo Buddies UTD will strive to bring everyone together and bullet journal in order to encourage accountability and productivity in a cute and artistic manner.\n\nMission: The mission of Bujo Buddies UTD is to create a positive, friendly space for those interested in bullet journaling to come together and share ideas for bullet journaling spreads and explore the art of aesthetics, productivity, and organization in a medium which promotes creativity, design, and self care. Our purpose is to allow students to view bullet journaling as an stress-reliving organizational tool which only requires a space to express themselves, such as digital or traditional journal, and their own brilliant ideas. We seek to unite students in making planning their busy college lives more fun through friendships and bujo!",

A weekly spread would be taking one week from the monthly calendar and focusing on it more to highlight details on what is important for that given week. Bullet journaling appeals to those who are artistic and want to express themselves through beautiful calligraphy and stationery like stickers, cutouts, washi tape, colored pens, and more, but it also appeals to those who want a more organizational and functional form of planning. Outside of bullet journaling, our organization will also plan activities related to bullet journaling in some form such as calligraphy workshops, pen palling events, stationery swaps, and more. Most importantly, Bujo Buddies UTD emphasizes inclusion and friendship. We want everyone in our organization to feel comfortable and included as our members, and we want everyone to have their voices heard in terms of what type of events they would like to see. Whether one has been bullet journaling for years or is interested in getting started, Bujo Buddies UTD will strive to bring everyone together and bullet journal in order to encourage accountability and productivity in a cute and artistic manner.\n\nMission: The mission of Bujo Buddies UTD is to create a positive, friendly space for those interested in bullet journaling to come together and share ideas for bullet journaling spreads and explore the art of aesthetics, productivity, and organization in a medium that promotes creativity, design, and self-care. \n\nPurpose: Our purpose is to allow students to view bullet journaling as a stress-reliving organizational tool that only requires a space to express themselves, such as a digital or traditional journal, and their own brilliant ideas. We seek to unite students in the making planning their busy college lives more fun through friendships and bujo!",

Planned by the Brotherhood Committee, these events provide wonderful opportunities for brothers to relax after hard weeks, catch up with one another, and have fun!\n\nOur chapter believes that every new member should have someone that they are close to beyond what a large chapter can offer. Each new member gets a big brother before being initiated to help them with everything from fraternity life to school work. The big brother acts as a mentor and a best friend when they are in need. From this bond we build a lineage of strongly bound members that will often adopt the name of their founding brother. The big brothers are chosen shortly before initiation based on the personal relations of current members to the new members. We aim to have close connections between the brother to truly give them a sense of belonging in the chapter.",

Twelve motivated, South Asian young men developed this vision into existence. These men are now considered the founding fathers of the Beta Chapter of Delta Epsilon Psi Fraternity, Inc. They first set out with the goal of establishing a legitimate South Asian presence around campus at The University of Texas at Dallas. They strived to do this by utilizing the three pillars of Brotherhood, Discipline, and Commitment. This idea became a reality when the founding class of Delta Epsilon Psi Beta Chapter was officially recognized on August 6, 2000. At that moment Delta Epsilon Psi became the very first South Asian Fraternity on the campus.Once past the infancy stage, Delta Epsilon Psi began a phase of nationwide expansion. It began with other southern schools like Baylor University and University of South Florida. This rapid expansion marks the success of our fraternity by being so well supported that the small idea of eighteen young men has now developed into a nationwide operation to bring together South Asian students under the same fundamental ideas and philosophies.While Delta Epsilon Psi has grown to boast an impressive national presence, the Beta Chapter in Dallas holds to the roots it was established upon Fourteen years ago. This commitment has allowed us to maintain our position as one of Delta Epsilon Psi’s elite chapters.",

To top off the year, Dhunki competed at and won All-American Awaaz, the national competition hosted by ASA. \nAdditionally, being a part of one of the most diverse campuses in the country, creativity is limitless on this team. With 18 members from different regions of South Asia, the team is bursting with varying cultures, singing styles, music experiences, and stories. Putting that all together, Dhunki is able to feature singers of all types, thematic yet subtle choreography, costumes to represent South Asian brilliance, student teamwork, and so much more.\nWe hope to continue this new season of competitions with the same hard-working mindset, pride for our culture, and love of a cappella. Although it can sometimes get busy between school, rehearsals, and life, our love for music and each other makes it all worth it! The incredible feeling of accomplishment and camaraderie we forge in this group as we learn and sing together is what ties this family of singers together.",

MEDLIFE national hires and trains local staff to provide high quality 24/7/365 patient care, community development projects, and educational workshops to empower communities in need. These initiatives would not be possible without forming chapters at universities and high schools across the globe. MEDLIFE Chapters are the pillars of the movement. Our chapter would represent and promote MEDLIFE at UT Dallas and in our local communities. We would make an immeasurable impact - raising money for MEDLIFE, volunteering in Service Learning Trips, engaging in local community service initiatives, and more. We will work hand in hand with low-income communities and student groups to bring healthcare, education, and safe homes to the sites where we work, abroad or locally. The year-round effort will translate into hundreds of thousands of healthier families, better-informed individuals, and safer communities across Latin America, Africa and here in the DFW area. Overall, we aim to involve students, develop leadership skills, have the opportunity to make a difference, and build important connections that last a lifetime.",

This organization group falls under service as we plan on promoting education among peers and populations all over the world that are in need of services of a various array of services. Through this organization we plan on targeting a population source that is directly in need of aid in the realm of reading and writing (education), food, shelter and clothing. The service of the organization is not limited to the United States, but plans on doing work on a global platform. With the growing trend of this organization we hope to provide UTD students with ample opportunity to participate in volunteer services, mentorship, tutoring programs as well as several different fundraising projects that will directly raise funds to donate to different foundations. We believe that everyone should have an equal shot at life and providing adequate supplies to sustain life would be a huge step towards this cause. Through establishing this organization the aim will be to coordinate and work with differing projects and connect UTD students to these organizations devoted to promoting global relief. We value dedication, teamwork, empathy and equal opportunity for everyone so that they can receive the education that they deserve.",

The UT Dallas campus and its people can be the support needed to allow these puppies to grow into the trained professionals required by Canine Companions for Independence.  By puppy raising, puppy sitting, or volunteer and outreach we can affect a positive change in the lives of people in our local community, Texas, and beyond.\n\nThe purpose of UTD Service-dogs In Training (SIT), a chapter of Collegiate Canine Companions for Independence (C3I), is to help Canine Companions for Independence in caring for puppies. Canine Companions recently opened a training campus in Irving, Texas. They breed and train assistance dogs that they give to people with disabilities at no cost to the recipient. Our job as Puppy Raisers or Puppy Sitters is to provide a place to live as they grow up, to socialize them to other dogs and humans, and to help in the training process. It takes some dedication, but it is a rewarding part of the process.  UTD SIT will also have general volunteers to assist Canine Companions for Independence with their need for volunteers at fundraisers, awareness and outreach, and various other tasks asked of their normal volunteer.",

		"description": "STRIVE was founded in 2019 to help underprivileged students in the DFW metroplex have the chance to live up to their true potential. Our initiative first started as a means for Refugee and ESL students to work with select mentors. Our work focused on helping the students overcome language barriers, learn that diversity is indeed accepted, and to think beyond primary education. This initiative was a success as we had a lot of students interested in higher education after various discussions.\n\nUnfortunately, many of them struggled to gain acceptance due to the compounding effects of the language barrier. Without a solid grasp of English, performance in various other subjects takes a significant hit. Based on this dilemma, we decided that it was essential to develop a tutoring program for these students to connect them with tutor-mentors from similar backgrounds who would guide the students and allow them to overcome this barrier.\n\nWe see a bright future for these students, and we want to tap into their potential by providing them with one-on-one subject strategy training and educational advice. Our motto is that every student should have the right to succeed regardless of their background. Language should not be an obstacle to success. We currently work with Lake Highlands High School in the Richardson Independent School District (RISD).  Currently looking to expand, we look forward to continuing our mission to eliminate educational disparities.",
